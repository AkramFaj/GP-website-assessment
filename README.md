# GP Website Usability Assessment

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a critical assessment of the reliability and dependability of General Practice (GP) websites in the Bournemouth University area. The study evaluates usability factors such as user satisfaction, ease of navigation, and learnability. The objective is to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of five selected GP websites to improve patient experience and healthcare service delivery.

## Key Objectives:
- Identify usability challenges in healthcare websites.
- Analyze user satisfaction with the design and usability of GP websites.
- Assess user engagement using usability testing.
- Evaluate the simplicity and overall usability of GP websites.

## Scope
The study focuses on five GP websites:
1. Talbot Medical Centre
2. Bournemouth University Medical Centre
3. Westbourne Medical Centre
4. The Village Surgery
5. Haven Medical

## Methodology
- **Think-aloud Protocol**: Users verbalized their thoughts while interacting with the websites to identify usability issues.
- **Heuristic Approach**: Evaluators assessed the websites based on Nielsenâ€™s 10 usability heuristics to detect flaws.

## Results
- Westbourne Medical Centre had the best performance with an 86% completion rate.
- Talbot Medical Centre had the lowest performance, with a completion rate of 71% and a high error rate of 46%.
